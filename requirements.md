Hi! My name is Bohdan, I'm frontend developer at Vinelab and I'm glad to meet you!

I have created two interview tasks for candidates applying for Frontend Developer position at Vinelab. They are all based on my recent real-life tasks. Here they are, called by topics they are covering:

1. VanillaJS
2. CSS (SASS)

Each task is a separate Codesandbox project. To implement a task, fork the project first. Submit a link with the forked project after you are done.

.

#This is task number 2 - CSS (SASS)#

SASS is a CSS preprocessor we use widely in the company, you can check the syntax here https://sass-lang.com/

##Short description##

Before we start, open this Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15Wp2bMdmnqWd4gCWXOZPVooNUPdr-sOl?usp=sharing
The folder contains image and video attachments to the task.

Now, take a look at the file named screenshot.png. I captured this from our real-life product website.

The dialog window you see is called _Select Video_ - it's responsible for showing to the user three latest Instagram (IG) posts of some IG account. The user can choose one and then save their choice. You can see at the bottom the section called _Or Add Link_ where you can type the link manually. This section is not important in this task so I removed it.
As side note, the data (thumbnail URL, caption, date, post link) comes from our REST backend in JSON format.

For this test, I removed the Vue part and left only with pure rendered HTML. Then I copy-pasted SASS here, but removed most lines from it. Your task is to fullfill the missing parts. I marked the missing parts with a comment in styles.sass.

##Requirements##

Try to achieve the following design:
design-static.png
design-dynamic.mov

The ideal correspondence is **not** needed, i.e. you don't have to achieve 100% pixel-perfect similarity.

You are free to change **any** file in this project **as you wish**. The final rendered result is only thing that matters.

Bonus task (not mandatory):
bonus.mov

.

Questions are welcomed! Please contact your recruiter and then he/she will pass questions to me.

.

P.S. Codesandbox doesn't highlight SASS syntax for some reason. Sorry for that!
